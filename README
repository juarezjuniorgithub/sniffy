Sniffy is a general-purpose and high-performance network gateway, load balancer,
and proxy server with a wide variety of auditing/security testing features like
request blocking, interception, moderation, manipulation, cloning, and more.

Use Sniffy as a local proxy and turn on the auditing features to identify
security and privacy issues on your client or on the server you're testing,
or just use it as a simple and fast load balancer frontend for your web
property.

Note: Sniffy is still in pre-alpha, and needs to undergo many radical changes
before it is even near production-ready. Database schemas, configuration
settings, and even existing feature are not guaranteed to stay the same.
